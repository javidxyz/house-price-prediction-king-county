# House Price Prediction â€“ King County, Washington

This project involves predicting residential housing prices in King County, Washington, using regression models and exploratory data analysis. The dataset contains house sale data from May 2014 to May 2015, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of floors, and whether the property has a waterfront view.

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, visualization, and model building.

## Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and outliers.
- Apply simple and multiple linear regression to model house prices.
- Use polynomial regression through a Scikit-learn pipeline to capture non-linear relationships.
- Evaluate and interpret model performance.
